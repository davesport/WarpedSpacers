        <h3 id="wrgroup"> Writing group tips </h3>
        <p> When someone submits their writing to be critiqued, remember the sandwich: first say something good about the story, suggest an edit, and end with something positive. We critique the mechanics of a story: descriptions, plot development, character growth, etc. We don't critique your creative vision! </p> 
        
        <div> 
            <h3 id="contests"> Ongoing contests </h3>
                <p> There are lots of writing contests that you can participate in, but it can be hard to know which one is best for you. Judy Prey keeps track of writing contests for our group, and we've decided to share them with you as well! Judy recommends: </p>
            <ul> 
                <li> <a href="https://dailysciencefiction.com/"> Daily Science Fiction. </a> This is the best ongoing contest because each day, the site publishes a new short (really short, like flash fiction) science fiction story on their site. This is the only prize for winning the daily contest, but it is fun nevertheless, and it's nice to see your name on the site! This is a great opportunity to become published. </li>
                <li> <a href="https://winningwriters.com/"> Winning Writers. </a> This site hosts frequent contests, is reliable, and offers large prizes for its contest winners. This is a good opportunity to compete with a large group of writers. </li> 
                <li> <a href="https://mastersreview.com/short-story-award-for-new-writers/"> The Masters Review. </a> This site offers seasonal, short-story contests, and is aimed at emerging authors in particular. Not only does this contest offer a monetary prize, it offers agency review over the story submitted. </li> 
            </ul>
        </div> 

        <h3 id="publish"> How to publish </h3>
            <p> There are lots of ways to publish your work, which is exciting! There is online publishing, traditional book publishing, and magazine & short story publishing. Online publishing tends to be easier due to Amazon's "print on demand" system, in which authors can publish the digital copy of their book, and Amazon doesn't need to worry about sales because they will print the book as fits the book's demand. This also means you can't guarantee your pay. Traditional book publishing involves submitting your transcript, receiving a book deal, and editing your book until publication. This route is well-known and covered by lots of writers, whose advice we will showcase here. Magazine and short-story publishing is another good publishing route because of the high number of magazines and journals in existence that want to publish more content. Look for the right one, and you may find yourself published! </p>
        
        <h3 id="outside"> Books & articles about writing </h3>
            <p> Writers also write about writing. Here are links to full-text articles, books, & multimedia content on writing. Continue scrolling for writing quotes from the Spacers. </p>
