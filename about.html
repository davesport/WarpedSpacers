    <h2> About us </h2>

    <h4> History of the Warped Spacers: </h4> 
    <p> The Warped Spacers was founded by Steve and Judy Prey in 1987. The three were initially were part of a local Sacramento writing group, but by 1987, they wanted more critiquing, more discussion, and more science fiction. </p>
    
    <p> Caroline Williams, Dave Meek, Judy and Steve Prey were among the initial members of the group. They began meeting at each other's homes twice a month, then eventually moved their meetings to local restaurants where they were reading, critiquing and editing printed submissions of various group members. Over the years, members came and left the Sacramento area, and the group's size fluctuated. Most of the current members have become published authors of short stories, poetry, speculative fiction articles and/or books. </p>
    
    <p> During 2020, with the onset of Covid-19, the group moved to virtual Zoom meetings. Turns out, we love Zoom meetings! Now, all the Spacers can join in, even those who've moved away! Parents don't have to leave the kids at home, and everyone can stay cozy in their pajamas. Now, in 2022, we have 22 members! </p> 

    <p> In addition to writing speculative fiction, many members of the Warped Spacers have dedicated years of their time and expertise as volunteer docents at Sutter's Fort State Historic Park. </p>

        <h4> What kinds of stories do we write? </h4>
        <p> Nearly everyone in the group has written a short story. But over the years, the Warped Spacers have branched out and tried kinds of writing. Judy packs a punch in her sub-50 word story poems, Caroline reminds us that truth can be stranger than fiction in her science articles, and Chris makes us question what's real in his paranormal stories. We'll likely add more to this list, because we love to try out new styles! </p>
